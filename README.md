#Description
This repository contains the circuit board designs for the persistence of vision boards. It also contains the piece of custom code required to display the visually-palindromic phrase for display by the persistence of vision board

#Reprogramming Steps
1. Set up a breadboard and configure an Arduino Uno to behave as an ISP for the ATTiny85-20PU boards. The details for this can be found well-detailed here: [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Program-an-ATtiny-with-Arduino/ "Instructables")
2. Adapt the code found in the *PersistenceOfVision.ino* Arduino project to be showing the phrase of your choice
3. Test it out!
